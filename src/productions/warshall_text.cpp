        return R"(This is a graph. It is defined by a set of nodes and edges. Think of them as towns and roads between them. There are no one way streets so the graph is undirected.
You can describe the graph using an adjacency matrix. Each cell in the adjacency matrix is either 1 or 0. When the cell in the i-th column and j-th row is 1, there is an edge from the i-th to the j-th node in the graph. When it is 0 there is no edge.
Fun Fact: In the case of an undirected graph this is a symmetric matrix.

Hover over the nodes and you will see their respective rows and columns in the matrix highlighted.)";
    case 1:
        return R"(Now say you wanted to calculate the minimum path length between node a and node b. The path length is the amount of edges on the pathâ€”not the amount of nodes.
And now say you wanted to calculate this path length for any two nodes a and b. This results in a distance matrix, with the value in the i-th column and j-th row containing the path length from node i and j. If there is no path between these nodes, the value is inf.

The Floyd-Warshall can be used to calculate this matrix. It populates an initial distance matrix with 0 on the diagonal (when you have reached node b in 10 steps, you could also reach it in 11), 1 wherever there is a 1 in the adjacency matrix (i.e. there is an edge from a and b), and inf everywhere else.
The inf values represent a non-existent path with one that takes infinitely long to traverse.

Now that the initial distance matrix has been specified, you can hover over the nodes again and see their direct connections. You can also hover over the matrix's entries and the corresponding path will be highlighted in the graph.)";
    case 2:
        return R"(Now the algorithm goes through all nodes k (highlighted in blue) and checks for all other nodes a and b if the path from a to b can be shortened using k. If the path from a to k plus the path from k to b is shorter than the path that is already in the distance matrix (from a to b without using k), the matrix gets updated.

Once you have done that for every node k, you end up with the desired distance matrix.
You can update the matrix once by clickling 'Next Path' and update all paths until a new k needs to be used with 'Next K'.)";
        //     case 3:
        //         return R"(But what if you are not satisfied with the mere path length and want to know exactly what edges to take to get from a to b? This can also be done using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, we only need to modify it slightly. We create a second matrix, a next node matrix. It's value in the i-th column and j-th row represents the index of the node you need to go to next when you are at node i and want to get to node j. If there is no path from i to j the value is -1.
        // So to get all nodes on the path from node a to b, you need to do this:

        // c := a
        // add c to path
        // while (c != b) {
        //     c = value in c-th column and b-th row
        //     add c to path
        // })";
        //     case 4:
        //         return R"(Now onto calculating the next node matrix. Start with the diagonal being populated with it's column index (when you are at node a and want to go to node a, go to node a). Additionally everywhere there is a 1 in the adjacency matrix set the value in the i-th column and j-th row to j (when you are at node i, want to get to j and there is a node from i to j, go to j). Everywhere else set it to -1.
        // We go through the Floyd-Warshall algorithm as usual and every time node k is used to shorten the path from a to b, you need to get to k first when you are in a and want to go to b. So the next node matrix in the a-th column and b-th row gets updated with the value in the a-th column and k-th row.)";
    case 3:
        return R"(Now we have calculated every path length. Feel free to play around hovering over all matrix cells.

This is the end of our little adventure. You can change the size of the graph below and restart the presentation with a new graph.)";
